I am a first-year PhD student at [QUVA](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/quva/) lab at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Efstratios Gavves](https://www.egavves.com/) and [Taco Cohen](https://tacocohen.wordpress.com/). My current research focuses on causality and dynamical systems.

I got my master's degree in Data Science from [Skoltech](https://new.skoltech.ru/en/) and worked as a junior researcher at [Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (AIRI)](https://airi.net/). There I focused on Topological Data Analysis and Natural Language Processing. You can find my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=646PbvoAAAAJ).
